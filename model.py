Ozone is important as it helps filter out radiation from the sun. Gradually, this ozone starts to form a layer called the ozone layer. If you are old enough (which I'm not), you may remember the ozone gap, in which scientists discovered a gap in our ozone layer. This gap still exists over antarctica, albeit seasonally, closing up every summer do to stratospheric air from lower altitudes.\n")
